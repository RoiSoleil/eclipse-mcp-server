READ ONLY, and it neither starts nor stops anything: it draws a session eclipse_start_sampling already took, so a profile can be looked at again, or re-read through a different frameFilter, without sampling twice. The page is dark themed and entirely self contained, it is held in memory rather than written to disk, only the last few are kept, and all of them are gone when Eclipse restarts. It is served on the loopback interface behind an unguessable URL, because a browser cannot send the bearer token on a plain navigation; treat that URL as the secret it is. Pass open to have the IDE open it in the machine's browser, which is VISIBLE TO WHOEVER IS AT THE IDE. For a flight recording use eclipse_stop_flight_recording with show, which takes the same flags and can also render a .jfr file from disk through its file argument; allocation stacks are weighted by bytes there rather than by samples."; //$NON-NLS-1$
